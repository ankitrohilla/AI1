Artificial Intelligence assignment 1

The relevance of position of an alphabet depends upon if that character is also present in other strings and relative positioning and much more

And now I am gonna add the factor that adding hyphen to the string with maximum length will increase the required number of hyphens totally

Also will modify that hyphen thing to include eg
10 hyphens by smaller string and
1 hyphen by larger string
